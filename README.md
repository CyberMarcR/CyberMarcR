## Objectives
With a strong foundation in 1st Line IT Support, I’ve developed a growing interest in cybersecurity and am now actively pursuing a transition into the field. My goal is to build on my technical background and move into a role as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, where I can contribute to threat detection, incident response, and proactive network defense.

## Projects & Labs

| Project | Description | Tools Used |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| 🔍 **Network Scanning Practice** | Scanned my local network & public IP targets (`scanme.nmap.org`). Analyzed open ports & services. | Nmap, Linux |
| 🧰 **SSH Brute Force Log Simulation** | Simulated brute-force attempts and analyzed logs using `rsyslog` and `grep` in Kali Linux. | SSH, syslog, grep |
| 📄 **Logwatch Report Analysis** | Generated system reports and identified login attempts & failed sessions. | Logwatch, syslog |
| 🌐 **Web Server Scanning** | Used Nikto and Nmap to analyze vulnerable web servers. | Nikto, Nmap |
| 🧠 **TryHackMe Labs** | Completed rooms on networking, scanning, Linux fundamentals, and reconnaissance. | TryHackMe |
