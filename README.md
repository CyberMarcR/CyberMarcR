## Cybersecurity Portfolio – Marcus R

This is my cybersecurity portfolio, where I document hands-on learning, labs, and projects as I transition into the cybersecurity field. My focus is on building practical, real-world skills through structured experimentation, documentation, and continuous learning.
This portfolio is actively maintained and will be updated as I progress.

Feel free to connect with me as I grow in this field!

## About Me
I’m an IT professional with a strong background in 1st Line IT Support and a deep interest in cybersecurity and technical problem-solving. I am currently training in:
- Linux & Systems Administration
- Penetration Testing Fundamentals
- SOC Analyst Foundations
- Threat Intelligence

I focus on understanding not just how tools work, but why they behave the way they do, with an emphasis on documentation and learning outcomes.

I'm using tools such as; 

<!-- Nmap -->

<!-- Wireshark -->
