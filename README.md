## Objectives
With a strong foundation in 1st Line IT Support, I’ve developed a growing interest in cybersecurity and am now actively pursuing a transition into the field. My goal is to build on my technical background and move into a role as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, where I can contribute to threat detection, incident response, and proactive network defense.
